Day 1 progress: I got the bot to run, with a few very simple commands for manipulating sentences.
Bot can also join and leave voice chats. I decided to not go any further in terms of the musics functionality of the bot, and leave that aspect for last.
I should complete moderation commands instead. might work on slash commands on the side as well

things i will probably copy paste over and over again:
